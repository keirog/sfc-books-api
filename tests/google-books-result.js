A fast-talking, internet-addicted mafia accountant is brutally silenced by his Russian employers, and Zula - a talented young T\'Rain computer programmer - is abducted and bundled on to a private jet. As she is flown across the skies in the company of the terrified boyfriend she broke up with hours before, and a brilliant Hungarian hacker who may be her only hope, she finds herself sucked into a whirl of Chinese Secret Service agents and gun-toting American Survivalists; the Russian criminal underground and an al-Qaeda cell led by a charismatic Welshman; each a strand of a connected world that devastatingly converges in T\'Rain.

In 1925, one of the few remaining blank spots in the world was in the Amazon. Fawcett believed the impenetrable jungle held a secret to a large, complex civilization like El Dorado, which he christened the \'City of Z\'. When he and his son set out to find it, hoping to make one of the most important archeological discoveries in history, they warned that none should follow them in the event that they did not return. They vanished without a trace. For the next eighty years, hordes of explorers -- shocked that a man many deemed invincible could disappear in a land he knew better than anyone, and drawn by the centuries-old myth of El Dorado -- searched for the expedition and the city. Many died from starvation, disease, attacks by wild animals, and poisonous arrows. Others simply vanished. In The Lost City of Z, David Grann ventures into the hazardous wild world of the Amazon to retrace the footsteps of the great Colonel Fawcett and his followers, in a bracing attempt to solve one of the greatest mysteries. It is an irresistibly readable adventure story, a subtle examination of the strange and often violent encounters between Europeans and Amazonian tribes and a tale of lethal obsession.",\n    "industryIdentifiers": [\n     {\n      "type": "ISBN_13",\n      "identifier": "9781847378057"\n     },\n     {\n      "type": "ISBN_10",\n      "identifier": "1847378056"\n     }\n    ],\n    "readingModes": {\n     "text": true,\n     "image": false\n    },\n    "pageCount": 352,\n    "printType": "BOOK",\n    "categories": [\n     "History"\n    ],\n    "averageRating": 3.5,\n    "ratingsCount": 1946,\n    "maturityRating": "NOT_MATURE",\n    "allowAnonLogging": false,\n    "contentVersion": "preview-1.0.0",\n    "imageLinks": {\n     "smallThumbnail": "http://bks2.books.google.co.uk/books/content?id=L_HKUpskbQUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api",\n     "thumbnail": "http://bks2.books.google.co.uk/books/content?id=L_HKUpskbQUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"\n    },\n    "language": "en",\n    "previewLink": "http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L_HKUpskbQUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=seveneves&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&cd=5&source=gbs_api",\n    "infoLink": "http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L_HKUpskbQUC&dq=seveneves&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&source=gbs_api",\n    "canonicalVolumeLink": "http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Lost_City_of_Z.html?hl=&id=L_HKUpskbQUC"\n   },\n   "saleInfo": {\n    "country": "GB",\n    "saleability": "FOR_SALE",\n    "isEbook": true,\n    "listPrice": {\n     "amount": 6.33,\n     "currencyCode": "GBP"\n    },\n    "retailPrice": {\n     "amount": 6.33,\n     "currencyCode": "GBP"\n    },\n    "buyLink": "http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=L_HKUpskbQUC&dq=seveneves&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&buy=&source=gbs_api",\n    "offers": [\n     {\n      "finskyOfferType": 1,\n      "listPrice": {\n       "amountInMicros": 6330000.0,\n       "currencyCode": "GBP"\n      },\n      "retailPrice": {\n       "amountInMicros": 6330000.0,\n       "currencyCode": "GBP"\n      }\n     }\n    ]\n   },\n   "accessInfo": {\n    "country": "GB",\n    "viewability": "PARTIAL",\n    "embeddable": true,\n    "publicDomain": false,\n    "textToSpeechPermission": "ALLOWED_FOR_ACCESSIBILITY",\n    "epub": {\n     "isAvailable": true,\n     "acsTokenLink": "http://books.google.co.uk/books/download/The_Lost_City_of_Z-sample-epub.acsm?id=L_HKUpskbQUC&format=epub&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"\n    },\n    "pdf": {\n     "isAvailable": false\n    },\n    "webReaderLink": "http://books.google.co.uk/books/reader?id=L_HKUpskbQUC&as_pt=BOOKS&hl=&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&source=gbs_api",\n    "accessViewStatus": "SAMPLE",\n    "quoteSharingAllowed": false\n   },\n   "searchInfo": {\n    "textSnippet": "In The Lost City of Z, David Grann ventures into the hazardous wild world of the Amazon to retrace the footsteps of the great Colonel Fawcett and his followers, in a bracing attempt to solve one of the greatest mysteries."\n   }\n  }\n ]\n}\n';
